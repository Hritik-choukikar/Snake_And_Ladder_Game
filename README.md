## 🚀 Features

- 🎲 Multiple player strategy implementations (Classic, Proximity-Based)
- 🐍🐱‍🏍 Board configuration via external JSON/YAML files
- 🔧 Factory & Strategy design patterns applied
- 🧱 Clean folder structure with separation of concerns
- 🛠️ Easily extendable for new board mechanics or rules
-
## 🧠 Design Highlights

- **Modularity**: Each class/module can be reused or tested independently
- **Strategy Pattern**: Swap logic for player movement easily
- **Factory Pattern**: Decouple instantiation logic from main flow
- **Readability & Scalability**: Designed for extension to multiplayer, AI, or custom game rules
